# The big project - a little bit about me

Hi! I am Peppe. There are tons of stuff I love in life, but two things are big for me: the sea, and DYI. I am sure you guessed already where this is going.

## The sea

When I was a kid, for me vacation was the very same thing as going to the sea. My mother is a retired teacher, and back then we had a seaside appartment where she brought me and my syster for pretty much the whole summer holidays.

My dad also joined us for his days off, and sometimes we joined other family members who had a boat. These were sometimes short, sometimes longer trips, and I greatly enjoyed them all.

I see living the sea from a boat as a totally different thing than from the shore, even if the place is the same. I like to think that from a boat it's more living and less visiting it. The best memories I have in my life are days that start early in the morning with a dive into the calm, silent, refreshing water to start the day, before literally anything else.

No surprise, I always, always, dreamed of having a boat, and took my boat license as soon as I could - shortly after my driving licence - not much because I thought I'd soon do anything with it, but to sort of make a promise to myself.

Time passed and this dream kept being a dream, for lack of 💰, then lack of time (👨‍💻 and then 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦), but I constantly considered it in my life choices, getting closer and closer, and yesterday finally the magic happened.

I bought from a likeminded, incredibly lovely person a middle-aged vessel which is absolutely perfect. She's solid, reliable, and has plenty of safe space for young kids.

And she's middle-aged, so there's plenty of stuff to do here and there, which brings me to the next topic

## The DYI

My uncle, who is a boat owner and an engineer like me used to say: "what's broken can be fixed, and what works can be improved". People who like to tinker find inspiration anywhere, but boats in particular are a gold mine for DYI projects: lots of stuff breaks all the time, and lots of stuff can be improved. Boats are a tough environment for things: solicitations are constant and space is scarce.

I want to combine these to passions: own a boat because I love the sea, but also take it as an opportunity to learn new stuff through DYI projects.

I am so excited about what's coming that I want to keep a written memory of it. And at the same time, I'd love to share my learnings (and hopefully progress!) in case they can be useful - or fun! - to anybody.
